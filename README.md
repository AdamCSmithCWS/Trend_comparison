# Trend_comparison
example Bayesian hierarchical model for comparing species' population trends between two regions



model for comparing trend estimates from two (indexed by e) different analyses (or regions), for species (indexed by s)
for this comparison, e==1 are estimates from the US and e==2 from Canada
Model is modified from the grassland bird model from Link and Barker 2010, pg 90, also described in Sauer and Link 2002, Ecology 83:1743-1751
in essence, this is a paired t-test style comparison, that accounts for the imprecision in each s*e trend estimate.
